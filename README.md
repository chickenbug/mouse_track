# Current Tasks

## "Researching"
- rudimentary benchmark on local machine shows packet size of 4096 bytes is optimal.
- how many websockets can we support on a small digital ocean server?

- capture cursor positions on the front-end [done]
- benchmark NodeJS driver vs libmongoc on a simple insert workload
- couple issues:
    - we need a replica set, Atlas M0 won't cut it.

What is the max number of bytes we can have in memory at a given time?
